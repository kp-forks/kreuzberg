## NAPI-RS Implementation Details

### Native Performance

This binding uses NAPI-RS to provide native Node.js bindings with:

- **Zero-copy data transfer** between JavaScript and Rust layers
- **Native thread pool** for concurrent document processing
- **Direct memory management** for efficient large document handling
- **Binary-compatible** pre-built native modules across platforms

### Threading Model

- Single documents are processed synchronously or asynchronously in a dedicated thread
- Batch operations distribute work across available CPU cores
- Thread count is configurable but defaults to system CPU count
- Long-running extractions block the event loop unless using async APIs

### Memory Management

- Large documents (> 100 MB) are streamed to avoid loading entirely into memory
- Temporary files are created in system temp directory for extraction
- Memory is automatically released after extraction completion
- ONNX models are cached in memory for repeated embeddings operations
